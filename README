   - Health
	1 LP = 2 HP
	Learned from shrines
	Hearts are displaying the health in %
   - Mana
	1 LP = 2 ZP
	Learned from shrines
	Mana Information displayed with the /xp command
	Prints error if not enough mana for a spell left
   - Strength 
	2LP = 1 SP
	1 SP = + 0,5% Melee Damage
	Learned from NPC trainers
   - Alchemy 
	2LP = 1 AP
	1 AP = + 0,5% Magic Damage
	Learned from NPC trainers 
	learning Alchemy Skills (Spells) requires a certain amount of AP
   - Marksman
	2LP = 1 MKP
	1 MKP = + 0,5% Bow Damage
	- Learned from NPC trainers 
   - Skills
	- Sword I Apprentice
	- Sword II Journeyman
	- Sword III Master
	- Alchemy I Apprentice

	- Alchemy III Master    
        - Marksman I Apprentice
	- Marksman II Journeyman
	- Marksman III Master
	- Lockpick I Apprentice

   - NPC Trainers: Train combat/weapon abilities(skills) with LP   
   - Basic information ( Level, XP progress, Mana ect.) can be viewed with the "/xp" command 


Tool and Weapon System
   - weapon damage and durability depends on the players skills and strength 
   - no tool/weapon restriction

Mob System
   - drops are static and do not increase with level (i think that would be better)
   - mob health and damage increases with player level linearly
   - XP gains are increased linearly with level as well, and/or with clan bonuses
   - Mob level depending on the players level
   - different sized mobs?

   

Web statistics 
   - Character overview on PHP website (massiveminecraft.com/stats)
   - Looks about like this (Gothic 3 stats):
      

Admin Chests that give each person one time (for rewards)
   - Linked with a mysql db. DB starts empty, when player opens chest, name is added and thus flagged/blacklisted from chest 
       (or however it  makes most sense from a coding perspective).
   - Standalone Plugin?
   - Locked chests that require certain "picklock" skill to be opend


Spells
   - bind to stick (LMB/RMB/sLMB/sRMB)
   - types of spells?
	- Fireball (the classic)
	- Heal

Misc
   - Gold tools have special abilities (Gold Skill wich requires certain level?)
	- Golden Sword
	- Firesword with skill?




Brainstormed ideas about /Bribe:
	as a RP way to get alot of shit done, the main city is like.. the government of the land..
	you want your "rabble of people" to be a faction.. you /bribe an official to have them "recognized"
	want to stake a claim to some land? /bribe an official
	increase your faction’s land plot? /bribe ..
	want a chat channel for your faction? /bribe
	want to change yer faction name? /bribe
	it works as a server mechanic to get shit done w/o remembering 50 new commands... and it stays "in character" to do so
	can have costs be money, MP or both.. (maybe a sizable sum of money.. or a few MP)
